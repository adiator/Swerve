# Swerve

A 2D car evasion game built using **LibGDX** and **Scala**, where enemies behave intelligently thanks to a lightweight neural network. The model predicts enemy car speed based on its distance to the player, making each encounter dynamic and reactive.

The network is trained using **PyTorch** and deployed with **DJL** (Deep Java Library) at runtime.

# 🎮 Controls

- **W–S**: Move up and down
- **A–D**: Move left and right
- **Escape**: Pause the game

# 🧠 Neural Network

Enemy behavior is driven by a neural network trained in a **Jupyter notebook** on player distance and position. The model is loaded in-game using **DJL with the PyTorch backend**, allowing for intelligent and adaptive movement.
